										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Hi! I'm Hailey, a third-year Computer Science student @ the University of Houston - Clear Lake</p>
									</header>
									<p>My anticipated graduation date is May 2025 with a Bachelor of Computer Science and a minor in GIS. For the past seven years, I've been academically determined and willing to make sure I achieve greatness and go the extra mile. My strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, organized, and working well under pressure. I'm interested in Data Analytics and earning certifications while getting my degree.</p>                                   
									<p>While attending UHCL, I am a member of the Black Student Association, the Society of Women Engineers, the Association for Computing Machinery for Women, and the National Society for Black Engineers. I am currently learning more about Computer Science and coding. I am also attending various women in STEM conferences, finding internships to find my passion in Computer Science, and coding projects to gain experience and learn more about programming. </p>                                   
									<p>I attended the Young Women's College Preparatory Academy during middle school. The teachers highly encouraged young women to pursue careers in STEM, so from a young age, I was interested in STEM careers. I completed an Information Technology class in 8th and 10th grade, a PAP Computer Science course in 11th grade, and an AP Computer Science A to help further my interests in Computer Science and get more experience with coding. With my curiosity for Computer Science, I took edX courses, worked on coding on Minecraft with my school and coded on code.org many times during school. I graduated in May 2021 from Shadow Creek High School (GPA 3.67/4.00), where I was also a Dual Credit student attending Alvin Community College (GPA 3.45/4.00).</p>								</div>

																	<h4>2023 Mississippi Power Company - Power Delivery Intern </h4>
																	<p>During my junior year of college, I attended a summer internship with Mississippi Power Company (MPC) in Gulfport, MS where I performed weekly tasks related to applications used, ensuring they're smooth functioning and resolving any issues that arose, assisted in installing software and troubleshooting hardware for field mobile computers, ensuring optimal performance, utilized Oracle SQL Developer to create queries assigned by management, effectively extracting and manipulating data, designed Power BI dashboards using SQL assigned queries, providing insightful visualizations for data analysis,assisted with adding, removing, and updating features on ArcMap using GIS, contributing to accurate and up-to-date mapping, collaborated in creating, maintaining, and validating the accuracy of reports, ensuring data integrity, posted updates to the Distribution GIS database, ensuring accurate and timely information for stakeholders, created specialized map products, delivering high-quality visual representations of geospatial data, and successfully reconciled data conflicts, ensuring consistency and accuracy in database records.</p>

																	<h4> MPC FAES Form Completion Project (2023 MPC Power Delivery Internship) </h4>
																	<p>Over 3000 work orders needed to be completed. The primary goal of the MPC FAES Form completion project was to edit, add, and remove features on the DistGIS ArcMap from work orders received from service men and line crew. During the project, I leveraged my expertise in GIS and workflow automation using tools like ArcMap. I also utilize my strong problem-solving skills to identify accurate locations and interpret work orders. The successful completion of the MPC FAES Form Completion Project led to improved operational efficiency, reduced time duration of completing past work orders, more accurate NLC processing, and increased knowledge of completing work orders. Pictured is a visual representation of the FAES data collected. Clicking on the photo will take you to an Excel spreadsheet that includes all of the data collected.</p>
