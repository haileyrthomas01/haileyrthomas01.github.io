										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Hi! I'm Hailey, a third-year Computer Science student @ the University of Houston - Clear Lake</p>
									</header>
									<p>My anticipated graduation date is December 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. For the past seven years, I've been academically determined and willing to make sure I achieve greatness and go the extra mile. My strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, organized, and working well under pressure. I'm interested in Data Analytics and earning certifications while getting my degree.</p>                                   
									<p>While attending UHCL, I am a member of the UHCL Black Student Association, the Society of Women Engineers, the Association for Computing Machinery for Women, and the National Society for Black Engineers. I am currently learning more about Computer Science and coding. I am also attending various women in STEM conferences, finding internships to find my passion in Computer Science, and coding projects to gain experience and learn more about programming. </p>                                   
									<p>I attended the Young Women's College Preparatory Academy during middle school. The teachers highly encouraged young women to pursue careers in STEM, so from a young age, I was interested in STEM careers. I completed an Information Technology class in 8th and 10th grade, a PAP Computer Science course in 11th grade, and an AP Computer Science A to help further my interests in Computer Science and get more experience with coding. With my curiosity for Computer Science, I took edX courses, worked on coding on Minecraft with my school, and coded on code.org many times during school. I graduated in May 2021 from Shadow Creek High School (GPA 3.67/4.00), where I was also a Dual Credit student attending Alvin Community College (GPA 3.45/4.00).</p>

												<h4>GIS StoryMaps - The Brief History of Hip Hop</h4>
												<p>During my sophomore year of high school, I attended a summer program, learned about GIS, and created a GISStoryMaps about topics we found interesting. <a href="https://blog.hcde-texas.org/2019/08/05/high-school-students-learn-about-gis-storymaps/"> Here</a> is an article I was featured in. </p>

												<h4>GIS StoryMaps - The History of Black Literature</h4>
												<p>During my junior year of college, I created a StoryMap on a topic I found interesting for my Fundamentals of GIS class. 
													As part of my passion for geography and data visualization, I undertook a GIS StoryMap project to create an immersive and interactive narrative showcasing the historical and cultural significance of African-American literature. 
													Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, I integrated maps, multimedia, and textual content to trace the literary journeys of influential African-American writers. The project highlighted their impact on black literature, 
													connecting their works to geographical locations and historical contexts. Through this project, I aimed to promote awareness of the rich heritage of African-American voices and foster a deeper appreciation for their contributions to the literary world. </p>

																	<h4>MPC Poles and Attachment Dashboard Project (2024 MPC Power Delivery Internship)</h4>
																	<p>During my internship in 2024, in a project for Mississippi Power of Southern Company, I developed an automated and comprehensive dashboard that revolutionizes the way we manage and analyze our infrastructure assets. 
																		This robust tool provides a granular view of MPC Poles, AT&T Poles, and various attachments, enabling detailed monitoring across Coast, Pinebelt, and Meridian divisions. 
																		The dashboard intricately displays data on AT&T Attachments on MPC Poles, CTV Attachments on MPC Poles, poles with both AT&T and CTV Attachments, poles with singular AT&T Attachments, poles with exclusively CTV Attachments, MPC Poles without other attachments, and other miscellaneous attachments, ensuring a comprehensive infrastructure overview.
																		The implementation of this dashboard has significantly streamlined our data management processes, saving time and enhancing the precision of our infrastructure assessments. It has empowered Southern Company with the capability to make proactive, data-driven decisions, thereby improving our operational responsiveness and strategic planning. 
																		This project not only demonstrates my technical acumen in leveraging Oracle SQL Developer and advanced data visualization tools but also highlights my commitment to fostering technological innovation that drives organizational efficiency and success.</p>
