										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Hi! I'm Hailey, a third-year Computer Science student @ the University of Houston - Clear Lake</p>
									</header>
									<p>My anticipated graduation date is May 2025 with a Bachelor of Computer Science and a minor in GIS. For the past seven years, I've been academically determined and willing to make sure I achieve greatness and go the extra mile. My strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, organized, and working well under pressure. I'm interested in Data Analytics and earning certifications while getting my degree.</p>                                   
									<p>While attending UHCL, I am a member of the UHCL Black Student Association, the Society of Women Engineers, the Association for Computing Machinery for Women, and the National Society for Black Engineers. I am currently learning more about Computer Science and coding. I am also attending various women in STEM conferences, finding internships to find my passion in Computer Science, and coding projects to gain experience and learn more about programming. </p>                                   
									<p>I attended the Young Women's College Preparatory Academy during middle school. The teachers highly encouraged young women to pursue careers in STEM, so from a young age, I was interested in STEM careers. I completed an Information Technology class in 8th and 10th grade, a PAP Computer Science course in 11th grade, and an AP Computer Science A to help further my interests in Computer Science and get more experience with coding. With my curiosity for Computer Science, I took edX courses, worked on coding on Minecraft with my school, and coded on code.org many times during school. I graduated in May 2021 from Shadow Creek High School (GPA 3.67/4.00), where I was also a Dual Credit student attending Alvin Community College (GPA 3.45/4.00).</p>

												<h4>GIS StoryMaps - The History of Black Literature</h4>
												<p>During my junior year of college, I created a StoryMap on a topic I found interesting for my Fundamentals of GIS class. 
													As part of my passion for geography and data visualization, I undertook a GIS StoryMap project to create an immersive and interactive narrative showcasing the historical and cultural significance of African-American literature. 
													Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, I integrated maps, multimedia, and textual content to trace the literary journeys of influential African-American writers. The project highlighted their impact on black literature, 
													connecting their works to geographical locations and historical contexts. Through this project, I aimed to promote awareness of the rich heritage of African-American voices and foster a deeper appreciation for their contributions to the literary world. </p>
